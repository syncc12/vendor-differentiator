## Progress Summary
- Project requirements clarified: React.js frontend (JavaScript, npm, axios, react-router) and Django backend.
- Project scaffolded: React app created in `frontend/`, Django app created in `backend/` with virtual environment.
- README.md created with instructions for running both frontend and backend.

Next: Compile and run both servers to verify integration.

- Django API endpoint `/api/hello/` added.
- React page `/hello` fetches and displays data from backend using axios and react-router.
